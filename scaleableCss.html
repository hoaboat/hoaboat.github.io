		<h1>How to Write Scalable CSS in 3 Steps</h1>

		<p>This article is not about scalable CSS architecture; it is about writing CSS that will scale when one or a
			combination of the following things occur in your application or website:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>the content changes,</li>
			<li>the application/website localizes,</li>
			<li>the application/website becomes responsive, or</li>
			<li>a module/component is moved to a different container</li>
		</ul>

		<p>It's about writing CSS once and not having to revisit it when content or spacing changes.</p>

		<p>
			I've been a Web Developer, Front-end Engineer, User Interface Engineer, or whichever title you like to use
			for over a decade. I started as a contractor and worked
			my way up to being a Member of Technical Staff. Over the years I developed a passion for clean and
			scalable code because of a few passionate colleagues I've been privileged to work with.
			I gravitated towards CSS because I really love implementing challenging
			designs in a clean and scalable manner. I've been on many projects throughout the years
			and I keep noticing similar
			bugs and errors. They get fixed but in a manner that I would term "band-aid." The developers fix it for
			that particular use case, or for that particular page, or for that part of the application.
			They fail to look at it more broadly to find a solution that will work for all cases. And that's one of
			the reasons why I felt compelled to write this article; to help you identify the root of the problem.</p>

		<h2>Step one: ask the question, "Do the CSS rules accommodate content growth or shrinkage?"</h2>

		<p>While writing the CSS rules, keep in mind that the content will change. The length of the content will grow
			or shrink because of content modification or localization. Will the rules that you write work for one line,
			as well as, multiple lines of text?</p>

		<p>You may say that content rarely ever changes. According to <cite>Douglas Crockford</cite>, <q>That hardly ever happens
			is another way of saying it happens.</q> You may also ask, "Why should I care about that?" If the content
			changes, I'll just go and change the rule. Or when localization occurs, I can take care of that with a
			language stylesheet. The reasons you should care are <strong>scalability</strong> and
			<strong>maintainability</strong>. You don't want to
			change your CSS rules every time content changes. If you localize to more than 200 countries, you don't
			want to possibly maintain that many stylesheets. You simply cannot move fast with all the things you
			need to remember to modify.
		</p>

		<p>Let's see two examples of CSS solutions that accommodate for content change.</p>

		<p>Example 1: customized checkbox</p>

		<img src="images/useBillingAddress.png" alt="customized checkbox example" class="billing">

		<p>At first glance, the customized checkbox looks simple enough to implement.
			A copy of a live implementation of this customized checkbox can be found
			<a href="http://hoaboat.github.io/nonscalableCheckbox.html" target="_blank">here</a>. As can be seen
			by the example, the CSS rules do not accommodate for content growth.
			How then are we going to handle the situation when the content grows to two or three lines of text?
			Do we change the
			rule when the content changes? Do we use JavaScript to detect the container height to add a different
			class? Do we add a language stylesheet to handle content growth due to localization? How about we choose
			none of those options and
			<a href="http://hoaboat.github.io/customizedCheckbox.html" target="_blank">implement this</a>
			instead. This implementation gracefully handles the content growth. No JavaScript is needed.
			No extra stylesheet is needed. No re-visiting the code is needed. The solution is pretty DRY.</p>

		<p>Example 2: customized shadow</p>

		<img src="images/customizedShadow.png" alt="customized shadow example">

		<p>A example of the code to accomplish this could be as follows:</p>

<pre><code>
	.container::after {
		content: "";
		position: absolute;
		top: 0;
		right: -5px;
		width: 5px;
		height: 100px;
		background-image: -webkit-linear-gradient(left, black, transparent);
		background-image: -moz-linear-gradient(left, black, transparent);
		background-image: -o-linear-gradient(left, black, transparent);
		background-image: linear-gradient(left, black, transparent);
	}
</code></pre>

		<p>Let's ask the first question in a slightly different way. Do the CSS rules above accommodate for a
			growth in the container height? No, it doesn't. The height is fixed. This was actually a bug logged against
			an application and the fix was to use JavaScript to detect the container height to change the shadow's
			height accordingly. When I heard about the solution, I didn't like it. It worked, but it just didn't sit
			right with me. I thought there had to be another solution that didn't involve using JavaScript. Then one
			day while I was prototyping using absolute positioning, I
			came up with a CSS solution to the fixed-height shadow bug&mdash;something that I had forgotten about
			absolute positioning; I could set the top and bottom offsets to
			zero so that the customized shadow will grow and shrink with its container. Let's see
			the code for the <a href="http://hoaboat.github.io/positionAbsolute.html" target="_blank">customized
			shadow</a>. Go ahead and change the height of the container and watch the shadow adjust seamlessly.
			</p>

		<h2>Steps two: ask the question, "Does the CSS rule accommodate changes in parents?"</h2>

		<p>With more sites becoming responsive, this question becomes quite pertinent. Are you using fixed units in
			your modules and changing their values at each breakpoint? If you do this, then every time a new
			breakpoint is added, you will need to modify the values for that breakpoint. This isn't a scalable
			solution. What you want to do is make the module's width fluid so that it conforms to its parent's
			width. But making a module's width fluid isn't just simply replacing the fixed units with percentages.
			Example 3 will demonstrate this. Even if your site isn't responsive,
			this technique will be helpful if you ever need to move a module to a different part of the page. The
			module will just expand or contract to fit its new parent's width.</p>

		<p>Example 3: form input with buttons</p>

		<img src="images/inputWithButtons.png" alt="form input with buttons example" class="controls">

		<p>The current live implementation of this module has the input width declared as a percentage of the parent
			and the buttons are floated left like below:</p>

<pre><code>
	.codeContainer {
		width: 75%;
	}

	.refresh,
	.audio {
		float: left;
		width: 38px;
	}
</code></pre>

		<p>The problem with the code above is that there will always be some empty space on the right of the buttons
			except for <em>one</em> scenario when the module's total width actually equals the parent's width.
			The challenge here is with the two buttons on the right. We want to maintain the width of those buttons.
			How then can we make this module's width fluid? We cannot use percentages because that will distort the
			buttons. After removing a few things to simplify the example but preserving the existing HTML structure, I
			came up with this <a href="http://hoaboat.github.io/inputWithButtons.html" target="_blank">
				solution</a> which works down to Internet Explorer 8.</p>

		<h2>Step three: know your CSS</h2>

		<p>Did you answer "no" to either question one or two? If so, then you should work on step three. There's more
			to CSS than just changing border color, font size, or padding. It is one of only <em>three</em>
			essential technologies for front-end development so please don't marginalize it. Unfortunately
			though, I witness CSS being marginalized over and over again by development managers <em>and</em>
			developers.</p>

		<p>For instance, I'm on interview panels, and when a candidate is not strong in CSS, members on the interview
		panel brush off that fact by justifying the candidate can learn CSS on the job. Thereby
		implying that CSS is so easy to understand and master. I can tell you that it takes years to learn and master
			CSS on the job because <em>I</em> have learned it on the job. Recently, because of my CSS
			experience I've been asked to
			teach a few CSS courses to the application developers at my company. I've also been asked to give
			presentations about CSS to different teams. All of this has opened my eyes to how
			difficult CSS is. I never really thought about how difficult CSS can be because I love what I do.
			I challenge myself with CSS in my spare time because it doesn't feel like work to me. I love
			accomplishing the designs the User Experience Designers give to me. Because it doesn't
			feel like work to me I forget that there's a lot to remember and learn about CSS and expertise comes
			with a lot of use and a ton of practice. These developers who have JavaScript prowess but are weak in CSS are easy to spot when it comes time for
			code reviews or pull request reviews because I see code like Example 4 and 5 below:</p>

		<p>Example 4:</p>

		<pre><code>
	&lt;div class="blueIcon"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
		</code></pre>

		<p>Example 5:</p>

		<pre><code>
	&lt;ul class="credit"&gt;
		if (cards === 5) {
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="someUrl"&gt;card 1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="someUrl"&gt;card 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="someUrl"&gt;card 3&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="someUrl"&gt;card 4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="someUrl"&gt;card 5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		} else if (cards < 5) {
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="someUrl"&gt;card 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="someUrl"&gt;card 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="someUrl"&gt;card 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="someUrl"&gt;card 4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		}
	&lt;/ul&gt;
			</code></pre>

		<p>Example 4 indicates that the developer is a novice with CSS. Why? Because one of the first things you learn
			is to not name classes that describe of the visual presentation. If the visual presentation changes, the
			classes make no more sense. Then you'd have to go and change the class names everywhere they are used.
			This is not scalable or maintainable.
		</p>

		<p>Example 5 indicates that the developer has little experience with CSS layout properties. Using JavaScript
			they are changing the HTML so the cards can be laid out differently when the number exceeds four. There is
			no separation of concerns here and all the JavaScript logic and extra HTML is completely unnecessary
			if the developer had known more about the properties <code>float</code> and <code>display</code>.
		</p>

		<p>Having development managers who marginalize CSS feeds its marginalization. I know of application
			development managers who only care that their developers write good JavaScript. They promote many
			JavaScript conferences, but they don't promote or care for CSS conferences.
			They disregard the importance of CSS expertise and experience. When development managers marginalize CSS,
			they groom developers to not care about CSS. Which leads to poor
			CSS quality, visual bugs, and a CSS maintenance nightmare. Case in point, I know a team that took over three
			months to upgrade their CSS framework. Having taught developers about CSS and witnessing their confusion,
			I'm appalled that development managers feel CSS is not as difficult or technical as other
			technologies.</p>

		<p>Please don't misunderstand me, I agree that CSS can be learned on the job; <em>anything</em> can be learned
			on the job given enough time. But in order to be truly experienced with CSS, you must use it constantly.
			You must experiment
			with it. You must get frustrated with it and fail at it. And you must keep trying to get it right.
			Proficiency in JavaScript or any other technology doesn't come within one week, or within one month, or
			even within six months, so how can you expect proficiency in CSS to be any different? Writing clean,
			concise, scalable, and well-designed CSS is just as important as
			writing clean, concise, scalable, and well-designed JavaScript.
		</p>

		<p>If your web application has a user interface then CSS is very important. So why is there more focus on
			writing good and scalable JavaScript for the behavior layer than on writing good and scalable CSS for
			the presentation layer? CSS has fundamentals that need to be understood well and a great number of
			properties that no one individual could possibly know all. I urge you all to understand the fundamentals
			and learn as many properties as you can because with a strong CSS foundation, a large arsenal of properties,
			and a yearning to make things better, you can come up with some creative and scalable CSS solutions.
			<cite>Kevin Ashton</cite> in <cite>How to Fly a Horse</cite> puts it nicely,
		</p>

		<blockquote>
			The human race's creative power is distributed in all of us, not concentrated in some of us. Our creations
			are to great and too numerous to come from a few steps by a few people. They must come from many steps and
			many people.
		</blockquote>

		<p>Even if you answered "yes" to one or both question one and two above, you should still work on step three
			because the more you know, the better a developer you will be.
